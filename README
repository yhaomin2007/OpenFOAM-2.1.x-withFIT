# OpenFOAM-2.1.x-withFIT
OpenFOAM-2.1.x use FIT property code
By Haomin Yuan, Phd project at University of Wisconsin Madison, Department of Engineering Physics

Discription:
The shared codes are based on the open source CFD code OpenFOAM. Its thermophysic model is modified to use a user-defined property module, FIT. 

The codes of the modified part and other suplementary files are stored in this project. 
The solver is also uploaded with an example case file. 

Foldersï¼š
hRhoThermo:  This folder should be put  thermalphysics/basic/rhoThermo/hRhoThermo folder.

hRhoSimplecFoam:   Solver that solve steady-state single-phase compressible N-S eqns.

FIT:	compiled shared object for properties of CO2. The source code of FIT property module cannot be released to public currently.

CO1:	example test case for supercritical CO2 flow through a circular orifice.
